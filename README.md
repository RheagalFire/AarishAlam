1.Perfoming Exploratory data analysis is the first part towards implementing a machine learning model . 
Here you will se that the data has been thoroughly visited and has been cleaned using numpy and pandas library of python 
2.Typecasting is very necessery feature in EDA. so make sure you typecast your data carefully.
3.Another very important step is filling null values . you should try to accurate out the null values by obtaining the exact data
but if for some reason you are not able to do so , it is advised to fill null values with mean of the values in that particular feature . 
4.Another steps towards EDA is scaling your data , now if you have data which is numerically large , you should try to trim it down to two digit no. by scaling the data. 
5.Finding Outliers and removing them is considered as a significant method to increase accuracy of your model . A very basic and traditional way of doing so is using boxplot graphs . 
6.Next is analysing data using different graphs . 
7.Label encoding is done to change categorical variables into numerical ones . 
8.Importing models using sklearn library and training and testing of data completes your project .
